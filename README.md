## Object Detection with YOLOV5 on the DSAIL PORINI DATASET
YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) is a popular object detection algorithm. It uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities for objects in an image. It is known for its high accuracy and speed, making it a popular choice for applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and image recognition. Below is a list of all the requirements you'll need to complete this project;
### Requirements
* PyTorch
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Open Cv
* Matplotlib

To use YOLOV5 for object detection,follow the following steps;
## 1. Dataset
The DSAIL Porini started is a dataset collected by DSAIL. It contains over 6000 images of animals from Dedan Kimathi University's Conservancy. The dataset contains 6 classes of animals, that is Zebras, impalas, warthog, waterbuck,bushbuck and monkeys. However for this project, we will be using 3 classes, Zebras, impalas and others. This is because we noticed that zerbas and impala are in most images from the dataset. The dataset is available at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/6mhrhn7rxc/6

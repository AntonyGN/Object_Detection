This repository will cover my journey in handling the Object Detection model for a dataset provided by the Center of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (DSAIL) known as the DSAIL Porini. The dataset containss over 8000 images of animals from the Dedan Kimathu University conservancy of animals in 6 classes. Impala, zebras, waterbucks, bushbucks, monkeys and warthogs. The lab has already done an image classification model on the dataset. I am going to handle object detection with YOLOV5 and if there is enough time, Tensorflow.
We'll walk through collecting the images for the test and train sets, the set should be balanced, we'll walk through the instance of every class, remember the dataset should we have a lot of variety, the annotations of your labels must be consistent, we'll walk through random splitting, creating the yaml file and also dividing the set into the images and label folders.

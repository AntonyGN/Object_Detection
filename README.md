## Object Detection with YOLO Algorithm
YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once) is a popular object detection algorithm. It uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities for objects in an image. It is known for its high accuracy and speed, making it a popular choice for applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and image recognition. Below is a list of all the requirements you'll need to complete this project;
### Requirements
* PyTorch
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Open Cv
* Matplotlib
* LabelImg

To use YOLOV5 for object detection,follow the following steps;
## 1. Dataset
## 2. Labelling the Images
## 3. Preparing the dataset.yaml file
## 4. Training the Model
## 5. Inferencing the Model
